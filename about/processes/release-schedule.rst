Release Schedule
================

OTA updates usually follow this rhythm:

-  devel: daily builds
-  rc: weekly if no critical issue exists in the devel channel
-  stable: every six through eight weeks, if no critical issue
   exists in the rc channel

This is not a definitive cycle. Stable releases are ready when they're
ready and should not introduce new bugs or ship very incomplete
features.
