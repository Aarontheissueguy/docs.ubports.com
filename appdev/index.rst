Design comes first - build upon solid principles
------------------------------------------------

From solid fundamental principles to refined UI building blocks and typography, all Ubuntu apps share a simple design and superb functionality.

The Ubuntu App platform - develop with seamless device integration
------------------------------------------------------------------

The list of Ubuntu App Platform APIs is long and constantly growing, integrating all Ubuntu apps seamlessly into the device experience, whatever the appâ€™s toolkit and coding language.

Security and privacy are not after-thoughts and are built at the core of our APIs to empower users and developers.

This tight integration also enables a true write-once, run-everywhere approach that conserves precious developer time.
