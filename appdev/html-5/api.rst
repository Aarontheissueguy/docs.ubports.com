HTML 5 API
==========

Ubuntu HTML5 APIs enable a rich set of technologies for your applications to integrate with and blend in with the platform. The documentation will provide you with detailed technical information and examples on how to make the most of device and platform functionalities.

.. note::
    The API documentation has not yet been imported. The old canonical documentation `can be found here <https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/apps/api-html5-development/index>`__.
