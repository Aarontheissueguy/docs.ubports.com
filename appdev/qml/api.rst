QML API
=======

The Ubuntu platform provides a rich set of technologies for your applications to integrate with and blend in with the desktop. The API documentation will provide you with detailed technical information on how to interact with the platform using the most popular programming languages.

.. note::
    The API documentation has not yet been imported. The old canonical documentation `can be found here <https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/apps/qml/api>`__.
