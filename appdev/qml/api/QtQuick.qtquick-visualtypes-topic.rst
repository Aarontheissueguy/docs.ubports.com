Most user-interfaces include some visual aspect. While multimodal
interfaces are extremely interesting and can be very engaging and
interactive (using, for example, haptic feedback and sounds to notify
the user of changes in the state of an application), visual objects in a
user-interface are able to convey a huge amount of information to the
user at a glance.
