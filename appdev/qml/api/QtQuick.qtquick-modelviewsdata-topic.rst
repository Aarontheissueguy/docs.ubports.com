Most applications will have data that needs to be displayed to the user.
That data might come from a variety of sources: network sources, local
files, and databases are all common sources of data.

It is often advantageous to show similar data in a similar manner,
within an application, and this gives rise to the idea of having a model
which contains data, and a view which displays the data. The view will
display a delegate for every datum in the model.
