QML - the best tool to unlock your creativity
---------------------------------------------

QML is an extremely powerful JavaScript-based declarative language for designing intuitive, natural and responsive user interfaces.  The Ubuntu SDK provides fluid and natural user interface QML elements that blend into Ubuntu without getting in the way. And with a rich framework and APIs, based on the cross-platform Qt framework, QML features an extensive set of APIs that cover the needs of the most demanding developers.

A powerful language to write compelling UIs
-------------------------------------------

QML, the Qt Meta-Object Language, is a programming language with similarities in syntax to JavaScript. Being a modern language designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind it has borrowed syntax and paradigms from ubiquitous web technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript. It is built upon and constitutes a core component of the cross-platform Qt framework. In essence, QML coupled with the underlying Qt libraries is a high-level UI technology that enables developers to create animated, touch-enabled UIs and light-weight applications. It differs from traditional procedural languages such as C or Python in the sense that it is declarative at its core, that is, it is used to describe UI elements and their interaction. As such, traditionally complex visual motion transitions become a natural part of QML and are extremely easy
to implement.
