SDK - the Ubuntu SDK
====================

.. Note::
    The Ubuntu SDK IDE is no longer supported by Canonical, and UBports does not currently have the means to continue its development. This section is provided *without any support* and for reference use only. Severe problems are expected when using the Ubuntu SDK IDE and it's tools.

The Ubuntu SDK is your full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Ubuntu apps.
