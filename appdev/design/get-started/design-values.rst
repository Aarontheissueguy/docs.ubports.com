All input types supported equally
---------------------------------

In order to achieve convergence, the toolkit has adapted all components
to work seamlessly across all devices with minimal changes to
functionality and visual appearance.

This means that touch, pointer and focus interactions are now mapped to
perform similar functions across different devices for a consistent and
familiar user experience. No matter what the input method, the UI will
respond to the user’s interaction with what they expect to happen
automatically.

Use case
--------

\|\ |no alt text|\ \|\ `For more details on how a seamless experience
can be achieved in your app, see Convergence <convergence.md>`__.\| \|
\|---\|-----\|

Fast and effortless interactions
--------------------------------

Allow users to effortlessly move through your app with minimum effort,
where it is both natural and logical to them.

Bottom edge
-----------

   366w\_BottomEdge\_AdditonalInfo3 (1)

The bottom edge allows for a natural progressive swipe from the bottom
of the screen. By using touch, clicking on the bottom edge tab with a
pointer, or pressing Return when the bottom edge tab is focused to open
using keyboard navigation.

Task switcher
-------------

   :alt: 366w\_DesignValues\_TaskSwitcher

   366w\_DesignValues\_TaskSwitcher

The task switcher allows the user to easily switch between apps or
scopes using a right edge swipe. By pushing the pointer against the
right edge of the screen, or pressing SUPER+W.

Action placement
----------------

Throughout the Ubuntu platform positive actions, such as OK, Yes and
Accept are placed on the right, and negative actions, such as Delete and
Cancel are placed on the left.

\|\ |no alt text|\ \|The position of positive and negative actions are
important to consider when designing your app, because it can reinforce
behavior when used in a consistent way.\| \| \|---\|-----\|

Negative swipes left
--------------------

   :alt: 366w\_ListItems\_ContextualActions1 (2)

   366w\_ListItems\_ContextualActions1 (2)

The user swipes left to right to reveals a red deletion option when
editing a contact.

Positive swipes right
---------------------

   :alt: 366w\_ListItems\_ContextualActions2

   366w\_ListItems\_ContextualActions2

The user swipes right to left to reveal contextual options, such as
information and messaging.

\|\ |no alt text|\ \|Users can access the same actions with a pointer or
keyboard by pressing the right mouse button or menu key to open a
context menu.\| \| \|---\|-----\|

Meaning in colors
-----------------

The Suru design language associates meanings with certain colours to
help the user distinguish between actions.

Most color blind people have difficulty distinguishing red from green.
Don’t use color in isolation, but instead bring them together with
additional visual cues (e.g. text labels, button position and style).

\|\ |no alt text|\ \|Think about how colors complement each other and
how they can create a harmony that is pleasing on the eye.\| \|
\|---\|-----\|

Green
-----

   :alt: 366w\_Overview\_MeaningInColoursGreen

   366w\_Overview\_MeaningInColoursGreen

Positive actions, such as OK, new, add or call.

Red

   :alt: 366w\_DesignValues\_MeaningInColoursRed

   366w\_DesignValues\_MeaningInColoursRed

Negative and destructive actions, such as delete or block contact.

Blue
----

   :alt: 750w\_DesignValues\_ColourBlue (1)

   750w\_DesignValues\_ColourBlue (1)

Blue is an informative colour, it is neither positive or negative. Use
blue for selected activity states. It works with all other elements, on
both dark and light backgrounds, and stands out clearly and precisely
when used in combination with a focus state.

\|\ |no alt text|\ \|For more information on how color is used across
the platform see Color palette (coming soon).\| \| \|---\|-----\|

Focus on content
----------------

Too much user interface can interfere with content; but too little can
make your app difficult to use. By focusing clearly on content many
pitfalls can be avoided.

Make it easy to find content
----------------------------

Allow users to access content easily through navigational methods by
using the most appropriate components.

|366w\_Overview\_FocusOnContentDO| |do\_32|

Do
--

The header can provide quick access to important actions and
navigational options at the top of the screen or window.

|366w\_Overview\_FocusOnContentDont| |dont\_32|

Don’t
-----

Drawers have low discoverability and can hide important views from the
user. Consider using the header or header section instead.
