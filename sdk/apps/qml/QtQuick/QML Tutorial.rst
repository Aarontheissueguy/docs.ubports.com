This tutorial gives an introduction to QML, the language for Qt Quick
UIs. It doesn't cover everything; the emphasis is on teaching the key
principles, and features are introduced as needed.

Through the different steps of this tutorial we will learn about QML
basic types, we will create our own QML component with properties and
signals, and we will create a simple animation with the help of states
and transitions.

Chapter one starts with a minimal "Hello world" program and the
following chapters introduce new concepts.

The tutorial's source code is located in the
``examples/quick/tutorials/helloworld`` directory.
