This tutorial walks step-by-step through the creation of a full
application using QML. It assumes that you already know the basics of
QML (for example, from reading the `simple
tutorial </sdk/apps/qml/QtQuick/qml-tutorial/>`__).

In this tutorial we write a game, *Same Game*, based on the Same Game
application included in the declarative ``examples`` directory, which
looks like this:

We will cover concepts for producing a fully functioning application,
including JavaScript integration, using QML `Qt Quick
States </sdk/apps/qml/QtQuick/State/>`__ and
`Behaviors </sdk/apps/qml/QtQuick/Behavior/>`__ to manage components and
enhance your interface, and storing persistent application data.

An understanding of JavaScript is helpful to understand parts of this
tutorial, but if you don't know JavaScript you can still get a feel for
how you can integrate backend logic to create and control QML types.
